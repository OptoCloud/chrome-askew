# Chrome Askew

Askew is a browser extension that drives its users to the edge of insanity.

- Over the course of an hour it tilts your webpage 0.7 degrees left then right
- Once every 5 minutes it blurs your webpage slightly for 0.1 seconds
- It hue's every image in your browser by a tiny bit
- Once every minute it scrolls your browser down by 2 pixels

Took inspiration from [Google](https://google.com/search?q=askew)

Extension is available in the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/askew/akmnlkamdcbmmcnglokpdlnicdkmhkee)
